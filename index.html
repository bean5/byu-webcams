    <!-- Camera images will be presented as images. They will be automatically reloaded according to the time intervals provided by the OIT service. The description for this challenge seemed a bit strange. Displaying a list, according to computer science, would mean to just dump the JSON, basically. As that would be dull and non-interactive, I opted to just show the images right off the bat. No need to let the user click for more information--it is mostly all provided up-front anyways. -->
